 * -	a root XML type from which XML types for all GML objects should be derived,
 * -	a pattern and components for GML properties,
 * -	patterns for collections and arrays, and components for generic collections and arrays,
 * -	components for associating metadata with GML objects,

 * A number of types and relationships are defined to represent the time-varying properties of geographic features. 
 * In a comprehensive treatment of spatiotemporal modeling, Langran (see Bibliography) distinguished three principal temporal entities: states, events, and evidence; the schema specified in the following Subclauses incorporates elements for each.

 * See ISO/DIS 19136 Clause 14.
 * Topology is the branch of mathematics describing the properties of objects which are invariant under continuous deformation. For example, a circle is topologically equivalent to an ellipse because one can be transformed into the other by stretching. In geographic modelling, the foremost use of topology is in accelerating computational geometry. The constructs of topology allow characterisation of the spatial relationships between objects using simple combinatorial or algebraic algorithms. Topology, realised by the appropriate geometry, also allows a compact and unambiguous mechanism for expressing shared geometry among geographic features.
 * There are four instantiable classes of primitive topology objects, one for each dimension up to 3D. In addition, topological complexes are supported, too. 
 * There is strong symmetry in the (topological boundary and coboundary) relationships between topology primitives of adjacent dimensions. Topology primitives are bounded by directed primitives of one lower dimension. The coboundary of each topology primitive is formed from directed topology primitives of one higher dimension.

 * See ISO/DIS 19136 20.3.
 * A coverage incorporates a mapping from a spatiotemporal domain to a range set, the latter providing the set in which the attribute values live.  The range set may be an arbitrary set including discrete lists, integer or floating point ranges, and multi-dimensional vector spaces.
 * A coverage can be viewed as the graph of the coverage function f:A Ã  B, that is as the set of ordered pairs {(x, f(x)) | where x is in A}. This view is especially applicable to the GML encoding of a coverage.  In the case of a discrete coverage, the domain set A is partitioned into a collection of subsets (typically a disjoint collection) A = UAi and the function f is constant on each Ai. For a spatial domain, the Ai are geometry elements, hence the coverage can be viewed as a collection of (geometry,value) pairs, where the value is an element of the range set.  If the spatial domain A is a topological space then the coverage can be viewed as a collection of (topology,value) pairs, where the topology element in the pair is a topological n-chain (in GML terms this is a gml:TopoPoint, gml:TopoCurve, gml:TopoSurface or gml:TopoSolid). 
 * A coverage is implemented as a GML feature. We can thus speak of a "temperature distribution feature", or a "remotely sensed image feature", or a "soil distribution feature".
 * As is the case for any GML object, a coverage object may also be the value of a property of a feature.

 * See ISO/DIS 19136 13.3.
 * The spatial-temporal coordinate reference systems schema components are divided into two logical parts. One part defines elements and types for XML encoding of abstract coordinate reference systems definitions. The larger part defines specialized constructs for XML encoding of definitions of the multiple concrete types of spatial-temporal coordinate reference systems.
 * These schema components encode the Coordinate Reference System packages of the UML Models of ISO 19111 Clause 8 and ISO/DIS 19136 D.3.10, with the exception of the abstract "SC_CRS" class.

 * See ISO/DIS 19136 Clause 19.
 * A GML observation models the act of observing, often with a camera, a person or some form of instrument.  An observation feature describes the "metadata" associated with an information capture event, together with a value for the result of the observation.  This covers a broad range of cases, from a tourist photo (not the photo but the act of taking the photo), to images acquired by space borne sensors or the measurement of a temperature 5 meters below the surfaces of a lake.
 * The basic structures introduced in this schema are intended to serve as the foundation for more comprehensive schemas for scientific, technical and engineering measurement schemas.

 * See ISO/DIS 19136 15.5.
 * A value in the time domain is measured relative to a temporal reference system. Common types of reference systems include calendars, ordinal temporal reference systems, and temporal coordinate systems (time elapsed since some epoch).  The primary temporal reference system for use with geographic information is the Gregorian Calendar and 24 hour local or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), but special applications may entail the use of alternative reference systems.  The Julian day numbering system is a temporal coordinate system that has an origin earlier than any known calendar, at noon on 1 January 4713 BC in the Julian proleptic calendar, and is useful in transformations between dates in different calendars.    
 * In GML seven concrete elements are used to describe temporal reference systems: gml:TimeReferenceSystem, gml:TimeCoordinateSystem, gml:TimeCalendar, gml:TimeCalendarEra, gml:TimeClock, gml:TimeOrdinalReferenceSystem, and gml:TimeOrdinalEra.

 * W3C XML Schema provides a set of built-in "simple" types which define methods for representing values as literals without internal markup.  These are described in W3C XML Schema Part 2:2001.  Because GML is an XML encoding in which instances are described using XML Schema, these simple types shall be used as far as possible and practical for the representation of data types.  W3C XML Schema also provides methods for defining 
 * -	new simple types by restriction and combination of the built-in types, and 
 * -	complex types, with simple content, but which also have XML attributes.  
 * In many places where a suitable built-in simple type is not available, simple content types derived using the XML Schema mechanisms are used for the representation of data types in GML.  
 * A set of these simple content types that are required by several GML components are defined in the basicTypes schema, as well as some elements based on them. These are primarily based around components needed to record amounts, counts, flags and terms, together with support for exceptions or null values.
